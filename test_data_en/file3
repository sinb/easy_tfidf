and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper
